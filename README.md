This project is nothing more than a bot (short for robot) developed with the Python language to be used in the Discord 
application (a messenger with text and audio support that allows you to make voice and video calls).
<br>
The purpose of this bot is to allow the user (or users) to run a D&D campaign within Discord that is completely digital, 
i.e. it allows them to play D&D within the Discord application without too many difficulties.
